# Description

By using Autodock-GPU and Vdock, docking results are obtained for more than 5 million small molecules.

# Inputs
 ### Target : Protein Structure
 - Public : Can search for protein names.
   - Choose alphafold model or PDB structure
 - private : From the TARGETS menu, select the added protein.

 ### Binding Site : The center of the selected residues, where the molecules binding locate.
 - Site : Forecast in the Site app, Select the part that will be docked.
 - Residue : If you don't select Site, You can enter a residue number directly.

 ### Screening option : 
- Number of iteration : Number of iterations of retraining for docking and machine learning
- Initial screen data : The first docked data, a database clustered using similarity
  - NR10 : similarity < 10, approx. 6,000
  - NR15 : similarity < 15, approx. 35,000
  - NR20 : similarity < 20, approx. 140,000
- Screen data
  - Mcule purchasable : Mcule's instock compounds, approx. 5M
  - Enamine lead-like : Enamine's Real Diversity set, approx. 38.2M
- Docking number of data
  - Number of ligands docked per iteration (smaller takes less time, larger increases accuracy) 
- Lipinsk's rule of five : Filter conditions for screening molecules
  - Molecule Weight <= 500
  - Hydrogen bond donor <= 5
  - Hydroget bond acceptor <= 10
  - LogP <= 5.0 

 ### V-Dock option : 
 - Method : Select a machine learning kinds.
 - Feature : The feature type of the molecule to be used for machine learning.
# Outputs
## Web page
### Target
Explore the length and 3D structure of a protein structure.
### Seed docking
 - Binding energy distribution for initial screen data
 - The frequency and interaction type of the residues interacting with the molecule. 
### Result
It shows the structure of the molecule bound to the protein and the three binding energies (AK-Score2 Energy, Autodock Energy, and Autodock Cluster Energy).
