# Description 

 AD3 Complex is the method for predicting complex structure using the AlphaFold-Gap method[1]. The AlphaFold-Gap method predicts a protein complex structure by using AlphaFold model with 200 residue gaps between chains. The difference between this method and AD3 Complex is in MSA generation step;
AD3 Complex uses the paired MSA generation method of Alphafold-multimer and AlphaFold-Gap uses mmseq2[2].
