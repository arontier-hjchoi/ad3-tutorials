# Description

Prediction model retrained by adding data to [MF-SuP-pKa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383522004622), a pKa prediction model.

Predicts acid pKa and base pKa, and ionization proceeds if they are lower or higher than the desired pH \.
If the results of acid pKa and base pKa conflict, the result is a large difference from the pH.
